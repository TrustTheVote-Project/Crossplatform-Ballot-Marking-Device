## Development workflow

To ensure a standardized development workflow, all new changes should be added as Pull Requests. In order to be merged to the main branch, PRs must be:

1. Passing all status checks (there are implemented using GitHub Actions)
2. Up to date with the main branch
3. Approved by at least one other person

When merging, the "squash and merge" strategy is used, which ensures all commits in the feature branch have been squashed to a single commit. This keeps the main branch's commit logs clean and readable.

## Standardization and Quality Checks

### Linting

This repo uses [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) to detect and prevent potential issues using static analysis.

ESlint will run automatically as a pre-commit hook anytime you attempt to make a commit. If it detects any problems, it will prevent the commit and alert you to the issue. Once remediated, you should be able to commit cleanly.

To run ESlint manually, execute the following:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Formatting

This repo uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure standardized formatting rules across the entire codebase.

It's generally a good idea to configure your IDE to format whenever you make a change to a file. If you're using VS Code, you should install the [Prettier extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and enable [format on save](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6#_format-on-save).

As an additional check, Prettier will run automatically as a pre-commit hook anytime you attempt to make a commit. Any files you have changed will be auto-formatted and added to your commit.

To run Prettier manually, execute the following:

```bash
npm run format:write # writes all formatting changes to disk
npm run format:check # will fail if more than one file is improperly formatted
```

### Unit testing

This repo uses [Karma](https://angular.io/guide/testing) for unit testing.

To run unit tests manually, execute the following:

```bash
npm run test
```

Unit tests will fail if any tests fail, or if code coverage drops below the enforced thresholds. Generally, ideal code coverage levels (for statements/branches/functions/lines) would be around 80%; however, this repo has been set to

To view detailed coverage reports, run the unit tests and then load `./coverage/index.html` in a web browser. This will allow you to view specific coverage information for any file in the repo.

### Integration testing

This repo uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for integration testing.

To run integration tests manually, execute the following:

```bash
npm run e2e
```
